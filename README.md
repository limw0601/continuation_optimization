# Sucessive continuation based optimization

The necessary conditions for constrained optimization problems include original system (constraints and objective function(al)) and adjoint system. Such necessary conditions are typically formulated as nonlinear boundary-value problems (BVP). After discretization, the BVP is converted into a set of nonlinear equations. Constructing reasonable initial guesses for such nonlinear equations is challenging. Kernévez and Doedel [], in which solutions to the necessary conditions for locally optimal solutions are found at the end of a sequence of easily initialized separate stages of continuation.
