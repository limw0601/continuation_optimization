demo1 corresponds to the case with infeasible initial solution (Fig.7 in the paper), while demo2 corresponds to
the case with feasible initial solution (Fig.8 in the paper). In demo2, FP3 is selected as starting point. You
may modify demo2 to obtain the case that FP2 as starting point (see lines 86-87).
